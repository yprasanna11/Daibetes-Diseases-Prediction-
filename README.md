# Daibetes-Diseases-Prediction-
ABSTRACT

Diabetes is caused due to the excessive amount of sugar condensed into the blood. Currently, it is considered as one of the lethal diseases in the world. People all around the globe are affected by this severe disease knowingly or unknowingly. Diabetes is seen in all age groups these days and they are attributed to lifestyle, genetic, stress and age factor. Foremost, predictive models enable early identification of individuals at risk of developing diabetes, facilitating timely interventions such as lifestyle modifications, diet adjustments, and targeted medical interventions to prevent or delay the onset of the disease. By forecasting future trends and prevalence rates, these models assist healthcare providers and policymakers in allocating resources effectively, ensuring that preventive measures and healthcare services are directed towards those most in need. It makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space. Previously they used different types of machine learning algorithm like Gradient Boosting, SVM. So, we are using some algorithm like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree.
